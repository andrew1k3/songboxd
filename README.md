# SongBoxd

A project created during my year 12 (2022), utilizing Spotify's API to create a platform where users can rate albums and songs.

## Description

SongBoxd is a platform I developed as a project during my final year of high school. It integrates with Spotify's API to provide users with the ability to rate albums and songs. Please note that this was essentially the first website I ever made, so the CSS and styling might not be optimal. While I'm not particularly proud of it, I believe in sharing progress and learning from it.
